New App I am creating and this is a start with the data done of the app in Django.
The code in this repository seems to primarily focus on setting up a Python virtual environment and managing its activation and deactivation.

Key findings:

PowerShell and Batch Scripts: Scripts like Activate.ps1 and activate.bat are used to activate a Python virtual environment.
Python Files: The __pip-runner__.py script ensures compatibility and runs pip within a different environment.
